# Model To Code

We use Jinja as a template engine:
https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/

General code generation will work as follows:
- Aggregate information from the model
- Map aggregated information to data set/entities? (is this named correctly)
- Instantiate template
- Call render(data)
