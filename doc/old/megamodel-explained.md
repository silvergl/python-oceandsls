# Megamodel Elements

In blue are all metamodeling parts including antlr and the grammar
file used for a particular language.
In yellow are all elements of a particular language processor.

## Parts

- **File** the input file for a parser
- **lexer** the lexer generated by ANTLR4, it creates all tokens 
- **Tokens** the tokens produced by the lexer
- **parser** the parser generateb by ANTLR4, it creates the AST
- **AST** the AST
- **Create Objects 4 AST Node** this transformation performs multiple steps
  (a) Walk over the AST and create the respective Objects for the AST without
      references and a list of AST node to Intermediate Model elements.
  (b) Fill in the Dictionary A which contains a list of all elements with a
      attribute name. The list contains the AST node belonging to a name.
- **Intermediate Model** the intermediate model for the AST
- **Link References** walk over all intermediate model elements, and resolve
  references based on the Dictionary A and the node to element map.
